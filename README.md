== Workshop of the World Visualization ==

The [location data](https://docs.google.com/a/ultrasaurus.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjPWVMj9wWa6dDJOVE5DVTRxbjc2Vy1PMVlQTlh4eFE#gid=0) was gathered from [Bridge Troll](http://www.bridgetroll.org/) and other reports of activity from workshop leaders who use alternate registration systems.  Contact Sarah Allen (@ultrasaurus) if you know of a city that is not representated.

This is a "spike" -- would be nice in the future:

* rollover to show city
* click to go to chapter website (if they've got one)
* put historical data that isn't in bridge troll there for hsitorical reference
* pull locations from an Bridge Troll API
