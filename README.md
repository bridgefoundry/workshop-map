== Workshop of the World Visualization ==

The [location data](https://docs.google.com/a/ultrasaurus.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjPWVMj9wWa6dDJOVE5DVTRxbjc2Vy1PMVlQTlh4eFE#gid=0) 
was gathered from [Bridge Troll](http://www.bridgetroll.org/) and other reports of activity from workshop leaders who use alternate registration systems.  Contact Sarah Allen (@ultrasaurus) if you know of a city that is not representated.

To run locally, here's a list of [HTTP server one-liners](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255)

## Wish List

Most of these depend on some data wrangling in Bridge Troll.  We would like
the source to be dynamic so this doesn't get out of date, before it gets too
fancy.  Right now, we don't have new locations very often, so this map is
still useful, even thought the locations file needs to be updated manually.

* pull locations dynamically from an Bridge Troll API -- see https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/issues/499
* interactive exploration that shows locations by Bridge (default to all)
* click to go to chapter website (if they've got one)
